Knitting as a Cognitive Anchor (Carousel),HelenBurgess.id.au,Instagram,Carousel,Scheduled,2026-01-28,"Some days my mind is noisy long before anything has actually happened.

That’s when I knit.

Not to “stay busy”. Not to distract myself.
To come back into my body.

Yarn over, pull through, slide off. Repeat.
The rhythm becomes a signal — we are safe enough to settle.

And that’s what makes knitting an anchor.
Not rigid. Not numbing.
Just tethering… so I can move within a range, without being swept away.

If you don’t knit, the principle still holds:
rhythm + repetition + predictability.
Something the nervous system can synchronise with.

Reel: Not distraction. Regulation.,HelenBurgess.id.au,Instagram,Reel,Scheduled,2026-01-30,"This is one of the most gentle truths I’ve learned:

Some coping doesn’t look like coping.
It looks like making. Like rhythm. Like repetition.

For me, knitting is a way to settle my nervous system — especially when my mind wants to run ahead of reality.

Not distraction.
Anchor.

Mini Carousel: What knitting teaches,HelenBurgess.id.au,Instagram,Carousel,Scheduled,2026-02-05,"Knitting has taught me things I couldn’t “think” my way into.

Patience. Presence. Recovery. Completion.

Not as concepts.
As lived experience — stitched into muscle memory.

And honestly… that might be why it helps.","#knittinglife #knittingtherapy #slowcraft #mindfulmaking #creativepractice #healingthroughart #somaticregulation","6-slide carousel. Focus on list of lessons."
