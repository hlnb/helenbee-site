          <h2 class="title">Welcome to My Digital Garden</h2>
          <p>
                This is where I plant stories instead of code—stories about healing, reflection, and the creative
    process. Here, technology becomes a bridge to meaning, and craft becomes a way to mend. Through every
    post, I hope you find a small piece of yourself reflected back—the part that still believes in growth,
    even after change.
          </p>



          <h3 class="subtitle">A Turning Point: Life after service</h3>
          <p>
            Leaving the RAAF asked for a different kind of courage. I learned that technology can do more than
        connect machines—it can reconnect people to purpose, to self, and to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>



          <h3 class="subtitle">Healing & Discovery: Weaving the past into meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Healing isn’t erasing what was; it’s weaving it into what is. Through writing, teaching, and making,
        I explore gentler ways to live with depth, honesty, and creative joy.
          </p>



          <h3 class="subtitle">For You: A small sanctuary</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re rebuilding identity, craving calm, or seeking a kinder rhythm—welcome. You belong here.
