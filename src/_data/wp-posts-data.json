Ouchy!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I had surgery to remove a bone from the CMC joint in December 2021 and have been doing rehab since then. I have a few pictures of my hand post-surgery, which I will upload here soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-f0a5d08f\"><h1 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">A bit of background<\/h1><p class=\"uagb-desc-text\">updated 01 Nov 2023<\/p><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">For those of us who have not had a hand injury or were born without \u201cnormal\u201d hands, we only have one set of hands, unlike some sci-fi characters. As such, we should give them a \u201chelping hand\u201d so that we can work as expected long into our old age without any pain added by our modern online way of living. I hope that we have all heard of \u2018Gamer\u2019s Thumb\u2019, \u2018Texting Thumb&#8217;, or \u2018knitter\u2019s thumb\u2019, yet did you know that they are all the same thing? RSI, or repetitive strain injury, can occur in any of these activities at the base of our thumbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I have been making things by knitting or crocheting since I was a young girl (about the age of 8) and, at the time, did not know that these activities contributed to having sore thumbs and hands. Personally, I have hypermobile joints in my body, which can cause a whole lot of other problems; however, I never thought that my thumbs would be part of that. When I was learning the piano as a six-year-old, I could easily span an octave on a standard keyboard. Not in my wildest dreams as a grownup did I think that my joints would be subjected to  pain!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">The jobs I have done have may also have something to do with the pain as well. Being a touch typist has been a boon in my work. My point is through, activities you do through your life contribute to this whether it be from typing, knitting using a mobile phone, tablet or game console you need to look after your hands to avoid such pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">About 15 years ago I started to get pains in the base of my right thumb. I was not knitting at the time so did not think that was the cause of it. I was however doing a lot of typing (as you do when you are coding &amp; teaching) as well as using my smartphone extensively. On seeing a physiotherapist, getting x-rays of my hand and other tests, I was diagnosed as having&nbsp;De quervain\u2019s syndrome.&nbsp; It sounded so scary. The physiotherapist at the time did not consider my highly mobile joints may have contributed to it. I was given advice to take anti-inflammatory drugs, rest my hand, wear a splint that supported my thumb and a series of exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">Although there is a name for this pain, it is Tenosynovitis of the tendons and surrounding structure of the thumb. Most of the exercises helped with the pain and I do them regularly now.&nbsp;Having a painful thumb and wrist can\/has sidelined me for weeks whilst I rest my joints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-inline-notice uagb-inline_notice__align-left uagb-block-9d4366f8\"><h4 class=\"uagb-notice-title\">Disclaimer<\/h4><div class=\"uagb-notice-text\">I am not a medical professional, and what I am writing about is my journey and what works for me. If you have thumb or hand pain,\u00a0go to your doctor to have it checked out, or see a physiotherapist.<br><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I use about a series of exercises that I find very helpful. I am providing links to videos that help explain what they are and how to do them from one of my favourite youtube Physiotherapists &#8211; Dr Jo. I use a stress ball to do the ball exercises and have a set of small hand weights instead of the can, although a 440g can of soup is good to use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I also use heat and cold on my hands. I have been know to put my hand into an ice bath for as long as I can stand it.I also have a small hot wheat bag that my hand can rest on when using heat.&nbsp;I take breaks and massage my forearm muscle groups as they can contribute to the pain as well when they get tight. When massaging my hands and forearms I like to use a natural anti-inflammatory cream (end up smelling of peppermint and pine). I make sure that I wash my hands thoroughly afterwards so that I don&#8217;t put anything in my eyes or mouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I also cannot stress enough the importance of proper posture whilst doing any activity that may cause pain. Ergonomics plays such a big part of my knitting and typing that I regularly check whether I have the right posture, holding my knitting needles as well as how I am sitting in the chair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">The exercises in the videos are the same ones my physiotherapist gave me. I just think seeing them is better than trying to write them down. For General Hand\/Joint\/Wrist health they are good to do as well.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-458a1fa2\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-image alignright uagb-block-752ebfc1 wp-block-uagb-image--layout-default wp-block-uagb-image--effect-static wp-block-uagb-image--align-right\"><figure class=\"wp-block-uagb-image__figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1-1024x299.jpg ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1.jpg 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1.jpg 360w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1-1024x299.jpg\" alt=\"image showing pain spot causes for wrist pain\" class=\"uag-image-1728 lazyload\" width=\"1024\" height=\"196\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/196;\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1-1024x299.jpg ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1.jpg 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/dequervanImage-1200x350-c-default-1-1024x299.jpg\" alt=\"image showing pain spot causes for wrist pain\" class=\"uag-image-1728\" width=\"1024\" height=\"196\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/section>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-9aa1cffe alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<section class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-7c489cb7\">\n<figure class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube eplus-wrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"De Quervain&#039;s Syndrome Stretches, aka Blackberry Thumb - Ask Doctor Jo\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7jeEZUGqDNw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" data-load-mode=\"1\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-4ae6fa56\">\n<figure class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube eplus-wrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"De Quervain&#039;s Syndrome Stretches, aka Blackberry Thumb - Ask Doctor Jo\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7jeEZUGqDNw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" data-load-mode=\"1\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-9e663149 alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<article class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-032dcb00\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-advanced-heading uagb-block-82c36667\"><h2 class=\"uagb-heading-text\">Final Thoughts on my Hands<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">I personally think that my thumb pain is a combination of all the hobbies and jobs I have done over the years with a keyboard and needles. I also think that my highly mobile joints have added to this as time went on. Who at&nbsp;<s>55<\/s>&nbsp;over 50 can bend their hand so their thumb almost touches the inside of their wrist.<br>I have given myself permission to stop when I need to, when the pain is at its greatest, do my hand exercises each day (using the videos as a reminder) and enjoy the massage of hands and forearms as much as possible.<br>I do think that having a doctor check out the pain is a good idea, and that having any sort of cortisone injection is not. What the medical professionals call &#8216;conservative treatment&#8217; works for me and it might just work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-image alignright uagb-block-9d14d7e3 wp-block-uagb-image--layout-default wp-block-uagb-image--effect-static wp-block-uagb-image--align-right\"><figure class=\"wp-block-uagb-image__figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark-300x149.png ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark.png 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark.png 360w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark-300x149.png\" alt=\"hb initials with square murray code.\" class=\"uag-image-1909 lazyload\" width=\"300\" height=\"149\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/149;\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark-300x149.png ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark.png 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/HelenB_HB-Logo-Dark-300x149.png\" alt=\"hb initials with square murray code.\" class=\"uag-image-1909\" width=\"300\" height=\"149\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/article>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-3c4adeea alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-image alignright uagb-block-a0b5fe16 wp-block-uagb-image--layout-default wp-block-uagb-image--effect-static wp-block-uagb-image--align-right\"><figure class=\"wp-block-uagb-image__figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash-1024x768.jpg ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash.jpg 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash.jpg 360w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" data-src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"uag-image-1813 lazyload\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/768;\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash-1024x768.jpg ,https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash.jpg 780w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 150px\" src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/pereanu-sebastian-qFH7-yKoxik-unsplash-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"uag-image-1813\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" title=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"\/><\/noscript><figcaption class=\"uagb-image-caption\">Photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@sebastian123?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Pereanu Sebastian<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/brown-and-black-typewriter-qFH7-yKoxik?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you have ever had a sore hand you know the inconvenience it can bring.

I decided on how many rows I needed as well as columns. I then used grid positioned according to whether the z-index is either higher or lower than one it is overlaid\/underlaid. Sort of a weave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-wrapper\">The images titles were created to be links. As it is navigation I used an unordered list with each list element containing a figure element.

Photograph: Roslyn Whitney<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-kN3uUb eplus-wrapper\"><em>&nbsp;<\/em><em>First published on <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@helenburgess\/anzac-day-and-being-a-peace-time-veteran-542a46a4c0a8\">Medium.com<\/a> Apr 17 2018<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-juQ3RD eplus-wrapper\">My name is Helen Burgess and I am a veteran, having served in the Royal Australian Air Force from 1984 until 2000. My service is during a time of peace where no major conflicts like we see today, so I have often had trouble reconciling myself to the label \u201cVeteran\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-PocHsG eplus-wrapper\">I joined the Air Force to serve the country I love, Australia. I was asked to give a talk to a group of primary school children for their ANZAC service, so I have been reflecting on what ANZAC Day means to me a veteran of the modern peace-time era. This is basically what I spoke to them about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-gJ7Qcm eplus-wrapper\">ANZAC day is about remembering my fellow military peers, where ever they are, those who have gone before through military action, those who are currently serving, and those who are like me, knowing that whatever service they have joined requires to be number 1 in their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-CoX26c eplus-wrapper\">Just as the school children were participating in an ANZAC Remembrance Service, I would participate in similar service as child about the same age as them. In my day it was all about the Landing at Gallipoli, the ingenuity of the Australians in landing in the wrong place and surviving. We would sing a song based on the poem \u201cMy Country\u201d by Dorothea Mac Kellar. The second verse particularly strikes a cord with me considering what Australia means to me and my family. The words are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\" eplus-XEp0On wp-block-quote eplus-wrapper is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>I love a sunburnt country<br>A land of sweeping plains<br>Of rugged mountain ranges<br>Of drought and flooding rains<br>I love her far horizons<br>I love her jewel sea<br>Her beauty and her terror<br>The wide brown land for me.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-F6qbWQ eplus-wrapper\">So this love of my country, embodied in this poem, led me in part to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1984. The other part was my love of Air Craft that I have had since I was six years old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-yePyuH eplus-wrapper\">I was a Communications Operator working in Communications Centres\u200a\u2014\u200athen when my job changed to be involved with computers the Base Information Technology Centres\u200a\u2014\u200aaround Australia. I would have loved to served overseas, although there were a few overseas operational opportunities\u200a\u2014\u200athat was not to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-alwEzS eplus-wrapper\">Partly due to old notions of what Women were capable of in the military. It was a time of change. The Women only services (WRAN, WRAAF and WRAAC) were being absorbed into main services, during the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. Roles like Pilot and Aircrew were being opened up to women. Some male counterparts often struggled with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-aEa6bm eplus-wrapper\">I would volunteer whenever a situation arose, to serve overseas, however my superiors at the time would not recommend me, particularly once I became a mother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-MzoVji eplus-wrapper\">As I said, old notions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-Ljo4xz eplus-wrapper\">This did not stop me serving though. I have participated in several military exercises providing communications support and rising up through the dizzying heights of Sergeant before discharging (i.e. leaving the RAAF). At the same time I married my husband (now for <s>31<\/s> 35 years) and had two boys &#8211; who are now <s>30<\/s> 35 and <s>25<\/s> 30 years old. My family followed me on my postings to the various bases I went to. My boys got to see quite a bit of Australia more than they would have if I had not been in the RAAF.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-uyIjOi eplus-wrapper\">One point I would like STRESS, is that not everyone in the military gets to go overseas or even participate in such campaigns as Timor, Afghanistan or Iraq. Being a veteran means that you are willing to go if called upon by your country and sometimes it means supporting those who go overseas back here in Australia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\" eplus-bKc6eI eplus-wrapper wp-block-heading\">Timor Crisis\u200a\u2014\u200aLife supporting others<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-21LZz1 eplus-wrapper\">One instance of this was during my time in Darwin in 1998 to 2000\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the very beginning through to the midst of campaign in Timor. RAAF Base Darwin was determined to be the centre of all air support and had various nations turn up on our door step to help with the Timor Crisis. I think the count was up somewhere between 10\u201320 at one time or other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-hAYPzq eplus-wrapper\">My role during this time was to ensure that communications facilities within the Northern Territory; particularly in Darwin; stayed online through various differing technologies employed at that time. I may not have been able to go over to Timor however I was on call every other week to support those who were in Timor. This meant I was on duty 24 hours of the Day, for that week. Often I would come home around 5:30pm in the afternoon, and\u200a \u2014 \u200ausually whilst I was having dinner with my family\u200a \u2014\u200a I would be called out for an emergency. There were lots of emergencies during the wet season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-X15vXh eplus-wrapper\">I would then not see my husband or children until the next day when I came home again. My boys were only at primary school during this time and found it hard that Mum could not spend time with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-KWxCzg eplus-wrapper\">There are other serving members whose job it was to load and unload cargo from the aircraft that went back and forth to Timor at all hours of the day and night as well as those men who refuelled the aircraft as needed 24 hours a day. There were only a couple of qualified aircraft refuelling experts on base as well and they had very little down time.<br>There was a lot of tired men and women as the requirements for support went up, with what limited personal RAAF Base Darwin had stretched to cover the requirements. It was a Support Base not an Operational base at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-zrEOAP eplus-wrapper\">Without the men and women of RAAF Base Darwin, &#8216;holding the fort&#8217; so to speak; things could have been different for all involved. So even though I did not go over the sea to Timor I spent many months supporting those who did by ensuring facilities in and around Darwin worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-splitcontent alignwide kt-sc_3f658a-36\"><div class=\"kt-split-content-wrap kt-sc-media-side-left\" style=\"grid-template-columns:50% auto\"><div class=\"kt-sc-imgcol kt-sc-imgcol-bg-auto kt-sc-img-side-left\"><figure class=\"kt-split-content-media-image wp-image-container-1662\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"839\" class=\"kt-split-content-img wp-image-1662 lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA-215x300.jpeg 215w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 600px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 600\/839;\" \/><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"839\" class=\"kt-split-content-img wp-image-1662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1_LKDWlBW3k2urxj8OaM0qyA-215x300.jpeg 215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/noscript><\/figure><\/div><div class=\"kt-sc-textcol kt-sc-text-valign-top kt-sc-text-halign-left\" style=\"min-height:440px\"><div class=\"kt-sc-innter-col\">\n<h3 class=\" eplus-KQDmf6 eplus-wrapper wp-block-heading\">Perceptions of Myself and ANZAC Day&nbsp;Now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-d2Y9LQ has-text-align-left eplus-wrapper\">I think no less of my service compared to others who have served overseas, now, although it has taken me a while to shed old thinking of \u201c it is only those who are in conflict that are veterans.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-mAp88r has-text-align-left eplus-wrapper\">It is often said that \u201cWhen service men and women enlist, we all sign a blank cheque to our country Australia that includes up to your life.\u201d As I stressed before not all are able to serve in conflict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\" eplus-2UpzGC has-text-align-left eplus-wrapper\">ANZAC Day is not a day for me to be thanked for my service.

These security concerns are not only just for eHealth; they are for all M2M communications within the domains of Smart Grids, Vehicular Networks and Smart Cars, Smart Houses, and other such networks. Part of this concern is the actual network topologies that are in use along with the networking standards. The other part is the size of the hardware\/application used in eHealth, in regards to memory and power supply. There have been some novel proposals of eHealth applications and what these may look like, yet when the discussion happens at the time of proposal, security takes second place in the implementation. Security is an afterthought. We live in a world that, unfortunately, has unscrupulous people within it. Any application we devise for eHealth needs to not only protect the users\u2019 information it also needs to protect their privacy. The approach to security within the eHealth or even the now touted mobile health (mHealth) arenas requires a multidisciplinary approach to solving some the security concerns within the use of such devices. eHealth can be separated into several subdomains; each having a set of requirements. From a network point of view, to standardised some of the componetry to provide secure transmission of data is a must. To use the now converging technologies of Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and cloud computing will allow standardisation of security as well as improvements in the care of patients by being more patient-centric in the monitoring of their health. This research will focus on collecting and comparing architectural models as well as how security has been proposed in these. Some of the security implementations are novel, yet all authors have come to the same conclusion that traditional security policies and measures are not appropriate for the new paradigm that is the Internet of Things and eHealth. This research will show the most appropriate way to ensure a patient\u2019s privacy and security of data from the various models proposed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-0peuyI wp-block-heading\">Introduction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-accordion alignnone\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-wrap kt-accordion-wrap kt-accordion-id_10d41d-60 kt-accordion-has-4-panes kt-active-pane-0 kt-accordion-block kt-pane-header-alignment-left kt-accodion-icon-style-arrow kt-accodion-icon-side-right\" style=\"max-width:none\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-inner-wrap\" data-allow-multiple-open=\"false\" data-start-open=\"0\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-pane kt-accordion-pane kt-accordion-pane-1 kt-pane_f54e57-39\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-header-wrap\"><button class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-header kt-acccordion-button-label-show\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title-wrap\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title\">Introduction<\/span><\/span><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-icon-trigger\"><\/span><\/button><\/div><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel-inner\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left eplus-LUzmXp\">With Berg Insight analysts forecasting that the global market for home monitoring devices integrated with cellular connectivity will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.4 per cent in the next five years to reach 19.2 million in 2020 (Bergl Insight, 2015). This has major impacts on security of data gathered as well as security of the networks used to transmit this data. This also impacts on how those networks will be used or integrated into a national eHealth monitoring system. There are several domains that are being explored for the use of M2M to enable the IoT. The domains according to Minoli are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-hUzzhM wp-block-list\"><li>Public services and smart cities<\/li><li>Automotive, fleet management, asset tracking<\/li><li>Commercial markets * Embedded networking systems in the smart home and smart office<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-dbCLHf\">The embedded networking systems can be further broken down to being:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-PUhzpK wp-block-list\"><li>Smart appliances<\/li><li>Automated home<\/li><li>Smart meters,<\/li><li>eHealth \u2013 assisted Living and in home health services (including remote monitoring and remote diagnostics)<\/li><li>Security and emergency services<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right eplus-kKhxkG\">(Minoli, 2013)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-QAeOUF\">The research will be focusing on the eHealth segment of embedded networking systems, with a particular look at the Cyber-Physical Systems and the various novel data security measures proposed through various articles in literature to date. Sebestyen, Hangan, Oniga, and Zolt\u00e1n G\u00e1l maintain that the eHealth domain \u201cshould set some requirements regarding data acquisition, access control, security and safety.\u201d (Sebestyen, Hangan, Ongia, &amp; G\u00e1l, 2014) especially as examples in this domain often purport the connection of devices to remotely monitor the elderly living at home for supervision and lifestyle enablement. This does not need to be an automated ubiquitous system, however that may be a point of contention between patient and medical staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-lz9id3\">In the paper \u201cThe Internet of Things for Health Care: A Comprehensive Survey\u201d the authors propose that there are three main issues in delivery of eHealth networks. These are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"eplus-ZR1dpo wp-block-list\"><li>The network topology as it refers to the different elements in eHealth and the various case study scenarios that it has been applied to already;<\/li><li>The architecture of applications in regards to their physical elements, the functionality and working principles plus techniques;<\/li><li>The platform, referring to both the network model and computing platform.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right eplus-Irp2J2\">(Riazul Islam, Kwak, Houssain, Kwak, &amp; Kabir, 2015)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-ShZH2o\">This bears investigation in light of the rise of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) being introduced into eHealth services and the ubiquitous solutions proposed by some providers of eHealth services for the care of patients and in home monitoring. Celentano and R\u00f6ning state that \u201cdependable services need to be implemented in a resource efficient and safe way \u2026 Security is a must when dealing with personal information.\u201d (Celentano &amp; R\u00f6ning, 2015). They expound that it may not just be the health providers that would require access to the information collected. The information may be used in forensic investigations, the smart insurance industry as well as governments to determine population well-being etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-MEr1pV\">Riazul Islam, Kwak, Kabir Houssain and Kwak provide a conceptual model of ubiquitous healthcare solution in their paper and this is shown below in Figure 1.This is a high level view of the elements required in this model. This model describes a heterogeneous computing environment where data is collected on such items as blood pressure, body temperature, electrocardiograms and even oxygen saturation via sensors and vital signs. This collected data can end up being an enormous amount to store. This model is based on Grid computing and transforms the static and mobile devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones, into a hybrid of type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image eplus-PHxvfV\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/iotbasedhealthcare-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/169;\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/helenburgess.tempurl.host\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/iotbasedhealthcare-300x169.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-168Ol0\">Figure 1: A conceptual diagram of IoT-based ubiquitous healthcare solution (Riazul Islam, Kwak, Houssain, Kwak, &amp; Kabir, 2015)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-XtgI1u\">Cyber-Physical System(CPS) is defined as where the virtual world intersects with the physical world. It is a System that integrates physical devices, such as sensors, with cyber components so that have an inbuilt analytical system which is able to respond intelligently to dynamic changes. Research into the CPS area was determined to be a key area in 2008 by the US National Science Foundation as well as being listed as a number one research priority by the US President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (Wang, Adid, Lee, Shu, &amp; Xia, 2011) Until now, CPS research and development has predominately been in the Smart Grid, automotive and traffic management domains in the IoT. Now this research is moving into the realm of eHealth due to advances made in the last five years in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), medical sensors and cloud computing. This makes CPS one of the major candidates for healthcare application solutions specifically in in-hospital and in-home patient care according to Milenkovic, Otto, and Jovanov. (Milenkovic, Otto, &amp; Jovanov, 2006).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-c8Z4wS\">The advantages of having a CPS are: that there is network integration as the networking architecture would comply with standards already in place; it would provide interaction between humans and the system to provide better decision making; having a valid and trustworthy system as it behaves in a known way in existing environments and is able to work in new and unreliable environments as well; system performance is better as the sensors are able to provide better feedback and end-user maintenance; it is scalable to large amount of users due to access to cloud computing infrastructure; It could provide autonomy due to the sensor-cloud integration; it would be flexible; and provide better response times. (Haque, Aziz, &amp; Rhaman, 2014) Sawand, Djahel, Zhang and Na\u00eft-Abesselam, proposed a CPS framework for eHealth monitoring that encompassed four major components. These components were: * Situational awareness sensors * Communication networks * Medical Data processing servers and * Clinical Terminals. They also asserted that \u201cthe quality of eHealth care service relies on the seamless integration of the above essential components\u201d (Ajmal, Djahel, Zhang, &amp; Na\u00eft-Abdesselam, 2014). \u201cenergy efficiency and patient privacy are always among the top concerns of eHealth care services\u201d. (Ajmal, Djahel, Zhang, &amp; Na\u00eft-Abdesselam, 2014) is also of importance in the development of eHealth CPS. Figure 2 is a diagram of the proposed CPS Architecture for eHealth Monitoring proposed in their paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image eplus-KRvzpZ\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/hlnbee\/image\/upload\/h_79,w_300\/v1550127500\/cpsArchitecture_ivpwxp.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: CPS Architecture for eHealth Monitoring\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/hlnbee\/image\/upload\/h_79,w_300\/v1550127500\/cpsArchitecture_ivpwxp.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: CPS Architecture for eHealth Monitoring\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-gB9XDD\">Figure 2: CPS Architecture for eHealth Monitoring<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-JuCs9r\">Security and privacy have also been highlighted in the existing literature, although Ajmal, Djahel, Zhang, and Na\u00eft-Abesselam have gone deeper and identified that security and privacy requirements for this technology space \u201cmust be taken into account from scratch of data collection, avoiding any post-processing with the purpose of enhancing security or privacy.\u201d (Ajmal, Djahel, Zhang, &amp; Na\u00eft-Abdesselam, 2014) This paper details some novel ways of protecting eHealth data by the use of Biometric cryptography in WBAN interconnection, as well as advance signal and image processing \u201cto achieve privacy-aware cloud-assisted healthcare monitoring system. \u2026 significantly benefit \u2026 improving secure and efficient eHealth monitoring system.\u201d (Ajmal, Djahel, Zhang, &amp; Na\u00eft-Abdesselam, 2014)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-DaW513\">Chen and Chang highlighted that \u201csecurity and privacy issues must be addressed before CPS can be widely deployed\u201d in diverse areas including assisted living and health care. (Chen &amp; Chang, 2012). Chen and Chang also purported that existing policies dealing with traditional application would be inadequate for CPS applications in all domains. They have provided their own architecture for a secure CPS that can be used across domains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-3Y4RzQ\">There are numerous threats to eHealth systems whether they be a CPS system or a Grid Hybrid system. These threats are similar to those already experienced on the internet in terms of physical security, social engineering as well as software attacks and direct access to the data. Habib and Leister have provided a comprehensive set of tables outlining not only threats; the identification of key assets and vulnerabilities, in the IoT paradigm. Other threats identified were data impairment; dropped data; counterfeit data; data collision and compromised data routing. Vulnerabilities revolve around usability of the application; unprotected environment as well as insufficient awareness by both patient and staff. Habib and Leister also agree with Chen and Change in regards to existing policies and security mechanism not being up to the task of eHealth in IoT. (Habib &amp; Leister, 2015)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-19pknL\">To this end adaptive security technology is being developed for the IoT and eHealth applications. One of the major thoughts in this area of research is that of context aware security. One of the major trade-offs is that devices in eHealth have limited computing power, and limited energy resources. Hamdi and Abie propose a system using Markov game theory to balance the \u201ctrade-off between improving the mitigation capabilities of the BAN and extending the lifetime of the smart things.\u201d (Hamdi &amp; Abie, 2014) The usefulness of this approach for sensors in Body Area Networks where security effectiveness should be prioritised at a granular level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-QH19xC\">For a completely secure system in eHealth we believe the use-cases as described in the ETSI Technical Report, require a multilayer approach to ensure patient and data security and confidentiality. (ETSI, 2013). No one approach has the golden bullet for securing eHealth applications however this is not to say that implementing a cross-section of approaches would not be out of reach.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-pane kt-accordion-pane kt-accordion-pane-2 kt-pane_df8fa4-63\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-header-wrap\"><button class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-header kt-acccordion-button-label-show\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title-wrap\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title\">Methodology<\/span><\/span><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-icon-trigger\"><\/span><\/button><\/div><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel-inner\">\n<p class=\"eplus-WtbRXU\">This project will compare various M2M architectural networks that have been proposed for eHealth\/mHealth purposes. We will describe each network as proposed by their designers in detail and ascertain where the security components may lie within that architecture. We will also look at the various components used within eHealth applications and the network standards proposed to be used with those applications to see which ones are better suited for eHealth\/mHealth. The architectural networks will then be appraised as to their suitability for eHealth services implementation.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-pane kt-accordion-pane kt-accordion-pane-3 kt-pane_673ff3-e3\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-header-wrap\"><button class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-header kt-acccordion-button-label-show\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title-wrap\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title\">Project Management<\/span><\/span><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-icon-trigger\"><\/span><\/button><\/div><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel-inner\">\n<p class=\"eplus-j5Qo04\">As you can see from the image below this is the project timeline, tasks and resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image  eplus-pTGJrs\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/hlnbee\/image\/upload\/v1550127505\/Project-Chart-ITC571_g5t1kb.png\" alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/hlnbee\/image\/upload\/v1550127505\/Project-Chart-ITC571_g5t1kb.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/noscript><\/figure>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-pane kt-accordion-pane kt-accordion-pane-4 kt-pane_a1a746-ee\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-header-wrap\"><button class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-header kt-acccordion-button-label-show\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title-wrap\"><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-title\">References<\/span><\/span><span class=\"kt-blocks-accordion-icon-trigger\"><\/span><\/button><\/div><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel\"><div class=\"kt-accordion-panel-inner\">\n<p class=\"eplus-GKL5VU\">Ajmal, S., Djahel, S., Zhang, Z., &amp; Na\u00eft-Abdesselam, F.
