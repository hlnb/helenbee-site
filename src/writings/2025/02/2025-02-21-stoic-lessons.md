<div class="content">
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">You know those days when everything feels like it's conspiring against you? Last week, I had one of those moments. I was sitting in my car, stuck in traffic, running late for an appointment, and my anxiety was through the roof. But instead of spiraling into panic (like I might have done a few years ago), I found myself remembering something I'd learned from Stoic philosophy: "Some things are up to us, and some things are not."</p>

  <p>It might sound strange that ancient philosophy helps me manage my PTSD and anxiety, but hear me out. As a veteran and someone who's spent years navigating the choppy waters of trauma recovery, I've found that Stoic principles aren't just dusty old ideas - they're practical tools for surviving and thriving in our modern world. Let me share how these teachings have become my daily companions in building resilience.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">1. Focus on What You Can Control</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>Picture this: It's 2015, and I'm struggling to make sense of my PTSD diagnosis. I'd just finished listening to "The Courage to be Disliked" on Audible (thank you, algorithm!), and something about that book's philosophy resonated so deeply that I started following the "you might also like" suggestions. That's how I stumbled upon Ryan Holiday's "The Obstacle Is the Way." I remember thinking - great, another self-help book? Yet there was this quote from Epictetus that stopped me in my tracks:</p>

    <blockquote class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-dark pl-5 py-4">
      "Some things are up to us, and some things are not."
    </blockquote>

  <div class="box my-6">
    <h4 class="title is-5 mb-3">My Control/Can't Control List</h4>
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column">
        <h5 class="title is-6">Can't Control:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The job market</li>

        </ul>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">2. Reframe Adversity as an Opportunity</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>Here's something I never expected: losing my job at the college turned out to be one of the most transformative experiences of my life. Not because it was easy - it wasn't. I remember sitting in my car after clearing out my desk, having what felt like the mother of all panic attacks. But through the fog of anxiety, I remembered something Marcus Aurelius wrote:</p>

    <blockquote class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-dark pl-5 py-4">
      "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
    </blockquote>

  </div>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">3. Cultivate Mindfulness and Presence</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>You know what's funny about anxiety? It's like having a time machine that only goes to the worst possible futures or most painful parts of your past. That's where Seneca's wisdom hit me hard:</p>

    <blockquote class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-dark pl-5 py-4">
      "We suffer more in imagination than in reality."
    </blockquote>

  </div>

  <div class="notification is-light is-info my-6">
    <p class="has-text-weight-semibold mb-2">🎯 Daily Mindfulness Practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coding focus sessions</li>
      <li>Mindful exercise with my EP</li>
      <li>Morning coffee ritual</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">4. Embrace Discomfort to Build Strength</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>Let me tell you about my first session with my exercise physiologist. I walked in thinking, "How hard can this be?" after years of military PT. Then he had me do what seemed like a simple exercise, and suddenly I was face-to-face with how much strength I'd lost. My arthritis was screaming, my body felt like it was betraying me, and my ego was taking a serious beating.

    But here's where Seneca's wisdom about voluntary hardship hit home. He believed that deliberately facing discomfort could strengthen us against life's bigger challenges. It sounds masochistic, but stay with me here.

    Every Wednesday and Friday, I show up at the gym knowing it's going to be uncomfortable. Not just physically - though trust me, those sessions are no joke - but mentally too. Each rep is a small battle against the voice in my head saying "this is too hard" or "you can't do this." My EP keeps telling me to focus on form over weight, to build slowly, to trust the process. It's frustrating when you're used to pushing through pain the military way.

    But here's the thing - this controlled discomfort is teaching me something valuable. When I'm struggling with a particularly challenging piece of code, or facing a difficult writing deadline, or dealing with a PTSD trigger, I can draw on this same mindset. The discomfort isn't my enemy; it's my teacher. Each time I push through a challenging gym session, I'm not just building physical strength - I'm building mental resilience.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">5. Practice Gratitude and Acceptance</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>Here's a hard truth I've learned: acceptance isn't the same as giving up. For the longest time, I thought accepting my PTSD meant admitting defeat. I kept fighting against it, pushing myself to "get over it" or "be normal." Then I came across this quote from Marcus Aurelius:</p>

    <blockquote class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-dark pl-5 py-4">
      "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realise this, and you will find strength."
    </blockquote>
