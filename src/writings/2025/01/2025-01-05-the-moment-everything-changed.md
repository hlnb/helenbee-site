            <blockquote style="font-size: 2rem;"><em>“Not all wounds are visible. But that doesn’t mean they don’t exist.”</em></blockquote>
            <p>For <strong>16 years</strong>, I served in the <strong>Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)</strong>. My career in communications and cryptography was built on precision, discipline, and a deep sense of duty. But when I transitioned out of the military, I faced challenges I never expected—ones that weren’t talked about enough.</p>
            <p>I live with <strong>PTSD, anxiety, and depression</strong>. And for years, I felt like my struggles weren’t “valid” because I hadn’t served in a combat zone. But the truth is, <strong>PTSD doesn’t only come from the battlefield</strong>. It can come from any experience that leaves a lasting impact.</p>

            <h2>The Turning Point: Speaking My Truth</h2>
            <p>In 2024, I had the opportunity to give <strong>evidence to the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide</strong>. It was one of the most challenging things I have ever done—reliving painful memories, confronting my trauma, and sharing my story.</p>
            <p>For too long, I believed that my PTSD wasn’t “serious enough” to be acknowledged. But standing there, I realized that <strong>every veteran’s story matters</strong>. No one should have to suffer in silence simply because their trauma doesn’t fit a traditional narrative.</p>

            <h2>Breaking the Silence</h2>
            <p>Although I can’t share all the details due to legal reasons, I can share this:</p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-brain"></i></span>
                    <strong>PTSD and mental health struggles among veterans are real</strong>—whether or not you've seen combat.</li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i></span>
                    <strong>The impact of military service doesn't disappear</strong> the day you leave the force.</li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i></span>
                    <strong>No one should feel ashamed or unworthy of seeking help.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Healing starts with speaking up, finding support, and understanding that <strong>you are not alone</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why I’m Sharing My Story</h2>
            <p>I’ve shifted my mission to <strong>mental health and PTSD awareness</strong>—using my platform to advocate for veterans who feel unseen. Through <strong>digital storytelling and advocacy</strong>, I hope to:</p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                    Raise <strong>awareness</strong> about PTSD beyond traditional narratives.</li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                    Support <strong>fellow veterans</strong> who feel unheard in their struggles.</li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span>
                    Break the stigma surrounding <strong>mental health in the veteran community</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If this resonates with you, I encourage you to reach out, share your own story, or connect with others who understand.</p>
