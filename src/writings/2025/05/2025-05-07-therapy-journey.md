  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-weight-medium">There's a certain vulnerability in admitting we need help. Like many others, I spent years navigating the complexities of mental health alone, believing I could manage everything independently. Today, I want to share my journey through various therapeutic approaches, not just as a story of personal growth, but as a beacon for others who might be standing where I once stood – uncertain about taking that first step.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">The First Step: Talk Therapy</h2>

  <p>My journey with mental health support began during my service in the RAAF, where I first experienced talk therapy with a psychologist. Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, involves regular sessions where you work through challenges, emotions, and experiences with a trained professional. Initially, the idea of opening up to a stranger felt daunting, especially within the military context. I struggled with feelings of inadequacy, believing that needing psychological support meant I wasn't strong enough to handle life's challenges on my own.</p>

  <p>The military culture at the time carried a significant stigma around mental health support. I found myself strategizing ways to end the sessions as quickly as possible, worried about how others might perceive me for seeking help. Looking back, I recognize how this stigma created additional barriers to my healing journey.</p>

  <p>Despite these early challenges, these sessions eventually became a cornerstone of my mental health maintenance. Through therapy, I've gained invaluable tools and insights that have transformed my approach to life's challenges. One of the most powerful tools has been my mantra, "not my monkeys, not my circus" – a reminder that not every problem belongs to me, even when others try to make everything my fault.</p>

  <p>A crucial breakthrough came in understanding the difference between acknowledging past experiences and maintaining a victim mindset. My psychologist helped me recognize that while difficult things had happened to me, I didn't have to let them define my future. This shift in perspective was liberating – realizing I have control over my thoughts and feelings, even in highly stressful situations. Since 2015, this understanding has been life-changing, helping me navigate challenging circumstances with greater resilience and self-awareness.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Finding Balance: The Role of Medication</h2>

  <p>My journey with psychiatric medication began in 1989, when I was first prescribed sleeping medication and SSRIs. Over the years, various medical officers and GPs prescribed these medications as if they were wonder drugs that would simply "fix" everything. This approach, while well-intentioned, oversimplified the complexity of mental health treatment.</p>

  <p>Since 2014, I've been on Prestiq (Desvenlafaxine), a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This medication journey has been something of a roller coaster – one psychiatrist increased my dosage, while my current psychiatrist, who believes in a more holistic approach, later lowered it, as I was having some not nice side effects. Through this experience, I've learned that medication management isn't always straightforward.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Exploring Modern Approaches: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</h2>

  <p>One of the more innovative treatments I've experienced is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). For those unfamiliar with TMS, it's a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific areas of the brain. The treatment begins with a brain MRI to create a detailed map for targeting the correct areas during treatment. Sessions can be scheduled daily or weekly, depending on the clinic and treatment plan.</p>

  <p>My TMS journey began when my current psychiatrist suggested it as an adjunct treatment to medication. Even though I was on a lower medication dose, my "bag of sad" (as I came to call it) wouldn't budge. I've now completed three rounds of daily TMS treatment, and I can genuinely say it has helped lighten the load of that bag of sad. After my first round of treatment, my husband noticed a remarkable change, commenting that I seemed more buoyant and bubbly than I had been in years.</p>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">The Power of Integrated Care</h2>

  <p>What I've learned through this journey is that mental health care isn't about finding a single "magic solution." Instead, it's about building a comprehensive approach that works for you. Having a psychiatrist who believes in holistic care has been transformative. He ensures open communication between all my healthcare providers – my GP, psychologist, and himself – allowing them to share important information that might affect my mental health.</p>

  <p>My current care plan includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Monthly sessions with my psychologist for ongoing talk therapy and tools to add to my toolbox</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Regular psychiatric check-ins every three months</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Medication management with clear explanations of how different drugs work, especially the lower of the dosage of Prestiq.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Past experience with TMS</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Regular exercise, which I do with my husband, benefiting both our mental health</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Attention to diet and its impact on long-term well-being</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">A Message for Those Hesitating</h2>

  <p>If you're reading this and wondering whether to reach out for help, particularly if you're serving or have served in the military, I want you to share something I've learned: the strength isn't in handling everything alone – it's in having the courage to ask for help. I understand the stigma, especially in military culture. I've lived through those feelings of inadequacy and the urge to end therapy as quickly as possible. But I've also experienced the transformative power of accepting help.</p>

  <p>Remember, you don't have to figure everything out at once. Start with one small step, whether it's:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Booking an initial appointment with a GP to discuss your concerns</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Reaching out to a psychologist to start building your mental health toolbox</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Learning more about different treatment options, from talk therapy to TMS</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Speaking with someone who has walked a similar path</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="title is-3 mt-6">Moving Forward</h2>

  <p>Today, I continue my journey with a comprehensive approach to mental health care. From my early reluctant therapy sessions in the RAAF to my current integrated care plan, I've learned that mental health isn't just about managing symptoms – it's about building a sustainable, holistic approach to wellbeing.</p>
