**End-of-Year Reflections: Growth, Gratitude, and New Horizons**

As another year comes to a close, I find myself reflecting on the journey that 2024 has been. It has been a year of creativity, learning, resilience, and self-discovery—a year that has left me both proud of my progress and inspired for what’s to come. Here, I’d like to share some of my key reflections and achievements, as well as the exciting new directions I’ve explored this year.

### **Creativity and Knitting**

This year, I’ve found so much joy and fulfillment in my creative projects. I am nearing completion of the Hue Shift Afghan rug for my youngest son, with only two border sides and around 20 rows left. It has been a labour of love, and every stitch reflects my care and thoughtfulness.

I also started a new project—the Ancient Gem shawl—and learned new cast-off techniques that have challenged and refined my knitting skills. Knitting continues to be a meditative practice for me, one that brings balance and calm amidst life’s busyness.

### **Personal Growth and Emotional Well-Being**

This year, I embraced an ‘aha’ moment from a Stoic newsletter that defined work as, “Whatever you consider meaningful and want to take seriously is your work.” This insight has reshaped how I organise my days, categorising my tasks into habits/routines, projects/work (including hobbies), and life activities like reading, gym sessions, and appointments. This structure has helped me prioritise what truly matters and maintain focus, even during times of uncertainty or challenge.

Gratitude has played a significant role in my growth this year. I’m particularly thankful for my Veteran Mindfulness Coach, who has supported my daily meditation practice using the Calm app, and for my new psychologist, who has helped me understand the roots of my perfectionism. Letting go of guilt surrounding my eldest son’s journey has been transformative, allowing me to approach life with greater compassion and self-acceptance.

I have also focused on nurturing relationships that bring joy and meaning to my life, including deepening connections with friends and family. At the same time, I have set boundaries around relationships that I find trying or toxic. This balance has allowed me to prioritise my well-being while strengthening the bonds that matter most.

### **Professional Achievements and Learning**

One of the highlights of this year was completing my second master’s degree—the Master of Applied Digital Marketing. This accomplishment has not only broadened my skill set but also inspired me to explore new ways of leveraging technology for personal and professional growth.

A major milestone has been rebuilding my personal website, helenburgess.id.au, using 11ty (a static site generator). This project has been a deep dive into the world of web development, and I’ve learned to pair program with AI tools. These tools have acted as my coding companion, helping me debug, learn new techniques, and bring my creative vision to life. The process has been both challenging and rewarding, giving me a renewed appreciation for problem-solving and innovation.

### **Community Engagement and Service**

Contributing to the North Beach RSL Sub-Branch has remained a source of fulfillment and purpose. This year, I’ve focused on storytelling, digital outreach, and improving the RSL’s online presence. These projects have allowed me to use my skills to give back to the community and strengthen connections with others.

### **Physical Health and Resilience**

Health has been a priority for me this year. Pilates on Mondays has continued to support my overall movement, strength, and rehabilitation. On Wednesdays and Fridays, I’ve worked with an Exercise Physiologist at the gym, focusing on building upper and lower body strength and improving balance. Despite challenges like arthritis in my left thumb, I’ve adapted my routines to stay consistent and make steady progress.

### **Looking Ahead to 2025**

As I reflect on 2024, I’m filled with gratitude for the lessons learned and the milestones achieved. Looking ahead to 2025, I’m excited to continue my creative projects, deepen my digital marketing expertise, and explore new ways to engage with my community. I plan to:

- Complete the Ancient Gem shawl and explore at least two new knitting patterns.
- Grow helenburgess.id.au with fresh content and enhanced functionality.
- Continue my mindfulness journey, extending my meditation practice to 15 minutes daily.
- Lead and contribute to impactful projects within the RSL.
- Strengthen relationships through gratitude and meaningful connections while maintaining boundaries around toxic or trying relationships.

### **Final Thoughts**

To my future self, I want to say: progress, not perfection. This year has taught me to celebrate small wins, embrace challenges as opportunities, and honour the journey as much as the destination. As 2025 unfolds, I hope to carry these lessons forward, living with intention and gratitude.

Thank you for being part of my journey. Here’s to a year of growth, creativity, and connection!

With warmth and optimism,

Helen
