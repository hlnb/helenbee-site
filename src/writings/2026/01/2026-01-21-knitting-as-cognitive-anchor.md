My hands know the rhythm before my mind catches up.

Yarn over, pull through, slide off. Repeat.

The motion is automatic now—muscle memory built through thousands of stitches, hundreds of hours of repetition. Yet it wasn’t always.

When I first learned to knit, every stitch required conscious attention. My hands fumbled. The tension was uneven. I had to think through each movement: where the needle goes, how the yarn wraps, which loop to pull through.

Now, years later, I can knit while watching television, during conversations, in waiting rooms, on long car trips. My hands move independently, creating fabric while my conscious mind does something else entirely.

This is what makes knitting an anchor.

The motion is automatic now—muscle memory built through thousands of stitches. It wasn’t always.

Now, years later, I can knit while watching television, during conversations, in waiting rooms, on long car trips. My hands move independently, creating fabric while my conscious mind does something else entirely.

This is what makes knitting an anchor for attention and the body.

## \*\*The science of repetitive motion\*\*

There is neuroscience behind why activities like knitting, crochet, woodworking, or other rhythmic crafts create a sense of calm and focus. It isn’t just anecdotal or aesthetic—though those things matter too.

Repetitive, predictable movement is associated with activation of the \*\*parasympathetic nervous system\*\*, the branch of our autonomic system responsible for rest, digestion, and regulation. In simple terms, it can signal safety to the body a relationship reflected in craft studies showing relaxed-concentration states with increased parasympathetic indices, and surveys of knitters reporting mood and calm benefits (British Journal of Occupational Therapy; frontal midline theta craft research).

This kind of steady, familiar rhythm tells your nervous system: _we are not in danger_. We can settle.

For people living with trauma, anxiety, or chronic stress, this matters deeply.

Trauma often keeps the nervous system in a state of heightened alert. Even when there is no immediate threat, the body remains braced. Thoughts loop. Attention scatters. True rest becomes difficult.

Rhythmic, predictable motion can interrupt that loop. It gives the nervous system something steady and predictable to track—a tactile cue the body can synchronise with. The steady pace of knitting becomes a kind of physiological metronome.

There’s also a bilateral element to many crafts. Both hands work together, often crossing the body’s midline. Cross-lateral movement is widely used in somatic and trauma-informed practices because it supports coordination between left and right hemispheres of the brain—bridging cognition and sensation, thinking and feeling. In knitting, that can be as simple as passing the yarn and needles across your midline, alternating hands, or working knit-purl sequences that engage both sides in turn. Occupational therapy often leverages similar bilateral tasks to support regulation; clinical and practice reports in occupational therapy describe knitting as a coping intervention that supports clearer thinking, calm, and health outcomes (University of Gothenburg; BJOT).

It’s an embodiment practice disguised as craft.

That’s why such activities tend to feel grounding rather than numbing.

## \*\*The soul of it\*\*

Yet knitting isn’t just a nervous-system strategy. It’s also meaning-making.

There’s something deeply human about taking raw material—string, essentially—and transforming it into something functional or beautiful through patient repetition. You begin with potential and end with form.

Every stitch repeats, and the fabric grows—slowly, incrementally. A single stitch looks like nothing; thousands become a shawl, a blanket, a life.

This mirrors the work of healing. And of building anything that lasts.

Progress isn’t always visible in the moment. You trust the accumulation—the quiet, repetitive showing up.

I knit when I need grounding. When my thoughts are scattered or overwhelming. When I’m processing something difficult and don’t yet have language for it. My hands move, and something inside me settles.

## \*\*The anchor metaphor\*\*

An anchor doesn’t hold you rigid. It keeps you tethered while allowing movement within a range—drift, but not lost. Swing, but not swept away.

That’s what knitting does for me.

It doesn’t lock me in place or numb me out. It gives me a point of return. When my mind spirals or my nervous system floods, I come back to the rhythm. The texture of the yarn. The sound of needles clicking. The growing weight of fabric in my lap.

## \*\*What it teaches\*\*

Knitting has taught me:

- \*\*Patience\*\* — you can’t rush a row; the fabric forms at the pace it forms.

- \*\*Presence\*\* — attention matters, though not strain. Too little and you drop stitches; too much and the tension tightens.

- \*\*Recovery\*\* — mistakes happen. You can unravel and begin again. The yarn forgives.

- \*\*Completion\*\* — binding off, weaving in ends, finishing something in a world that rarely offers closure.

These lessons aren’t abstract. They live in the hands.

## \*\*For those who don’t knit\*\*

You don’t need needles and yarn to find an anchor. The principle applies to any rhythmic, embodied practice:

- crochet, embroidery, weaving

- woodworking, pottery, bread-making

- walking, swimming, running

- drumming, playing an instrument

- even washing dishes or folding laundry, when done with presence

The key is rhythm. Repetition. Predictability. Something your body can synchronise with. Something your hands can do while your nervous system settles.

If you live with trauma or chronic stress—if your system runs hot and grounding feels elusive—consider finding your version of this. Not as distraction.

As anchor.

Distraction scatters; anchor returns. If you’re curious, try five minutes today: pick a simple, repetitive motion—stitches, steps, notes—and notice your breath and shoulders as you settle into the rhythm.

\*\*What repetitive motion steadies you? What helps your body remember that it’s safe?\*\*

\* \* \*

### \*\*Research notes\*\*

This reflection draws on research from neuroscience, trauma studies, and occupational therapy showing that rhythmic, repetitive, and bilateral movements support nervous-system regulation. Such activities are associated with parasympathetic activation, may support emotional regulation, and can reduce physiological arousal—particularly for people living with chronic stress or trauma (e.g., British Journal of Occupational Therapy surveys of knitters reporting increased happiness and calm; craft-related frontal midline theta studies showing correlations between parasympathetic indices and focused relaxation)..

Studies of fibre crafts and other hand-based practices also highlight their role in attention regulation, mood support, and meaning-making; occupational therapists recognize yarn crafts as accessible coping tools that can improve short- and long-term wellbeing (University of Gothenburg reports; BJOT articles). Clinical observations and case reports describe knitting’s grounding value for trauma—helping shift attention from catastrophic loops to present-moment sensory cues. Related principles appear in polyvagal-informed approaches, EMDR-like bilateral stimulation, and occupational therapy’s use of cross-midline tasks. While research continues to develop—and systematic reviews directly comparing bilateral craft motions to EMDR or testing polyvagal mechanisms in knitting are limited—the available evidence consistently points to the value of embodied, repetitive activity as a stabilising force that supports psychological wellbeing and a sense of agency through making.
