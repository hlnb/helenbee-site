There's a specific kind of quiet that settles in when no one needs you urgently. It's not peaceful. Not at first. It sits in your chest like a question you can't articulate, a low hum of unease that follows you from room to room.

I notice it most on Sunday afternoons. The inbox is answered. The week's teaching materials are prepared. My partner is gaming in the next room, content. The dog is asleep in a patch of sunlight. Nothing is broken. Nothing requires fixing. And somewhere beneath my ribs, a small panic begins its slow crawl upward.

For years, usefulness was the architecture of my days. In the military, it was the foundation—you existed because you served a function within a larger mechanism. You were part of something that would grind to a halt without each component working exactly as designed. After that, teaching became a scaffold. Students needed you. Lessons needed planning. Questions needed answering. There was always someone waiting for a response, a next thing that couldn't happen without you showing up first.

I built my sense of self in the space between need and fulfillment. I knew who I was because I could point to what I'd done, what I'd solved, what would have gone worse without me. It wasn't vanity. It was something quieter than that. More like proof of existence.

The strange thing about chronic usefulness is how invisible its grip becomes. You don't notice you're holding yourself hostage to productivity until the rope is cut and you realise you don't know how to stand without it. The first few times I sat down without a task, I felt like I was forgetting something important. My hands didn't know what to do. My mind kept reaching for the next obligation, the next person who might need something, the next way to prove I hadn't just been taking up space.

I catch myself, even now, measuring the worth of a day by its output. Did I teach someone something? Did I solve a problem that mattered? Did I show up in a way that made a difference? And on the days when the answer is just "I existed," there's a creeping guilt that settles in. As if existing isn't enough.

I think about the people I've known who seemed comfortable in their own company, who could sit for an hour with a cup of tea and no agenda and not feel like they were wasting time. I used to think they had some secret I hadn't learned —some trick to quiet the part of your brain that constantly calculates value. I'm starting to suspect it's not a trick at all. It's just a different foundation. One that doesn't require external validation to hold its shape.

There's grief in stepping back from constant responsibility. Real, strange, grief. You'd think it would feel like freedom—and sometimes it does—but mostly it feels like losing your footing. Like standing in a room you've been in a thousand times and suddenly not recognising where the walls are. The relief comes later, in small increments. A morning where you don't check your email first thing. An afternoon where you let yourself read for an hour without justifying it as research. The slow, unsteady practice of being present without needing to be productive.

But there's also this: the fear that if you're not useful, you're not wanted. That love and belonging are conditional on what you can provide. That people will tolerate your presence as long as you're solving something, but the moment you stop being the answer to someone else's problem, you become expendable. It's an old fear, older than I admit. It has roots in places I don't like to look at too closely.

I've started noticing how I reflexively offer help before anyone asks: interrupting to offer a solution no one requested; volunteering for things I don't want to do just to stay needed. To stay necessary. It's exhausting, this constant audition for worthiness. And the worst part is knowing that most of the time, no one's watching. No one's keeping score except me.

The dog stretches in her sunbeam, shifts position, goes back to sleep. She doesn't question whether she's earned her place on the couch. She doesn't measure her value by what she's accomplished today. She just is. And that's enough.

I wonder what it would feel like to extend that same grace to myself. To sit in the quiet and not immediately reach for proof that I deserve to be here. To let a day unfold without needing to earn it. To exist without the constant, low-grade anxiety that I'm only as valuable as my last contribution.

I don't have an answer. Just this slow, uncertain practice of loosening my grip on usefulness and seeing what's left underneath. Of learning to recognize myself in the spaces between tasks, in the moments when no one needs anything from me and I'm still here anyway.

The light shifts. The afternoon stretches out. I pick up my knitting—not because anyone needs a scarf, not because I'm making something useful, but because my hands want to move and that, for now, is reason enough.
