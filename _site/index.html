        <h2>Welcome to My Digital Garden &hellip;</h2>
        <p>
          &hellip; A haven where I explore the road less traveled, unravel the complexities of my journey, and find solace in the transformative power of web technologies. As a multifaceted individual, I wear multiple hats: I am a veteran, a devoted mother and doting nana, a master knitter, and a website developer. Above all, I am a seeker of meaning, drawing inspiration from great thinkers like Adler and the Stoics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been passionate about learning and sharing knowledge. My journey has taken me through various fields, each enriching my understanding and skills. I believe in the power of community and the importance of giving back.

        <h3>A Turning Point:</h3>
        <p>
          The year 2000 marked a pivotal moment in my life. I bid farewell to the RAAF and embarked on a 14-year journey in vocational education, specializing in web design and development. It was a chapter dedicated to finding healing and meaning, as I guided eager learners with meticulous precision, witnessing their growth and evolution.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My career path has been as diverse as it has been enlightening. Serving in the RAAF, I navigated the complexities of military life while finding solace in teaching and technology. From the challenges of loading telex machines to deciphering the enigma of the infamous ration pack, I thrived on problem-solving and illuminating the path forward for those around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After leaving the RAAF, I transitioned into education, where I found a new calling in teaching web design and development. This phase of my life was dedicated to helping others discover their potential and passion for technology.
        </p>
        <h3>The Quest for Healing and Discovery:</h3>
        <p>
          In 2015, I took another transformative step, intertwining the wisdom of Adler and the Stoics into my personal odyssey of healing and self-discovery. Through Codemaster Institute bootcamps, I found a platform to inspire and empower aspiring web enthusiasts, igniting their passion for the digital realm.
